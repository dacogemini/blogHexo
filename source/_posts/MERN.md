<p style='line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;'>I know this blog's motto is 'everything Node'. And I stand by that -it's a fine motto in fact. But I think it's about time to think outside the box! What this means for us is that we are going to dive into a full-fledged MERN stack application, complete with an Express framework, JSON Web token and a MongoDB database via MLab! Are you excited? I sure am! </p>
