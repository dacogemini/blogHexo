<p style='line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;'>I know this blog's motto is 'everything Node'. And I stand by that -it's a fine motto in fact. But I think it's about time to think outside the box! What this means for us is that we are going to dive into a full-fledged MERN stack application, complete with an Express framework, JSON Web token and a MongoDB database via mLab! Are you excited? I sure am! </p>

<p style='line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;'>In sticking with the standard practice of <em>tldr;</em>, I have decided to break up this post into a couple of different sections. How many sections? 
Well, that is a good question as there are a lot of moving parts to a MERN stack application. 
But for now, we'll get started with getting set up with Mongo DB via mLab.

<h2>Getting Started with MongoDB and MLab</h2>

<p style='line-height: 26px; font-size: 18px;'>So what exactly is mLab? In the simplist of terms, mLab is a remote MongoDB database or cloud database. Your database in mLab is easy to set up (you don't have to worry about configuring MongoDB on different platforms) and it provides a place for our database to live.
